# Calculator
I built a simple calculator using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The calculator has a basic interface that allows users to perform arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

The HTML code includes a form element that contains input fields for the numbers and buttons for the arithmetic operations. The CSS code styles the interface to make it visually appealing and user-friendly.

The JavaScript code handles the functionality of the calculator. It includes event listeners that detect user input and perform the corresponding arithmetic operation. The code also includes error handling to prevent users from entering invalid input.

Overall, building this calculator required a basic understanding of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It demonstrated my ability to create functional and visually appealing web applications and I have enabled light/dark theme.
